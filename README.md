This Git repository has the code for my web scraper (Dummy_Scraper.py), which scrapes my job listing website (listing_website_2024.html).
This data is then used to build the web app (app.py) with csv.json.py, along with csv files of other randomly generated data from previous years (job_data_2019.csv etc)
The job data is randomly generated using job_creator.py.
